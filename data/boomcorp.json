Clearing a tile will reveal crucial information about its surroundings.<br> Deduce: The numbers revealed tell you how many explosives are touching that tile. Use this information to logically deduce which tiles are safe and which are hiding a threat.<br> Mark: Once you have identified a threat, clear out rest of the tiles to mark the location of it.<br> Survive: One wrong move, one lapse in judgment, and the consequences will be... immediate and explosive. <br> <br> - Physics System: UE5's built-in physics engine with simulated actors and collision filtering. <br> <br> - Lighting: Fully dynamic lighting with Lumen (software ray tracing), tailored for performance. <br> <br> - Post process: Toon shading using post process materials with outline shader. <br> <br> - Input: Keyboard and Mouse support. <br> <br> - UI/UX: Minimal and sleek HUD. <br> <br> - Theme: Mixture of retro and scifi<br> <br> - Audio: Ambient soundscapes and sound effects for actions and UI's."

The goal was to take a simple idea and develop it into a complete and polished game from scratch, covering all stages from initial design and programming to final art and sound.<br><br>Solution: To meet the deadline, development was scoped appropriately, focusing on core gameplay mechanics and iterative design. Regular updates on progress were shared for accountability, ensuring every day I completed specific milestones.<br><br>Impact: The result was a successfully completed and published game, 'Boom Corp.', delivered before time. The project demonstrates the ability to manage a tight schedule, prioritize core features, and execute on a concept to deliver a polished and engaging experience from start to finish."
