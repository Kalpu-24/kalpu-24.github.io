However, when i tried to implement it as a widget, i hit a roadblock with the widget's limitations. <br> <br> I posted about this on my telegram channel and got a suggestion to implement it as a live wallpaper instead. This was a game-changer, allowing me to use the Android Live Wallpaper Engine and canvas API for smooth animations and adaptive design. <br> <br>However one limitation came as i could not use gestures as it will trigger system gestures like app drawer or notification panel, for which i adapted to buttons on screen. <br> <br>"
